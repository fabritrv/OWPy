# OWPy
Simple Python program that uses OpenWeatherMap's APIs to display temperature and humidity % for the next 36 hours, given a certain location.

#### HOW TO USE:
Insert in the main:
1. API key: get it at OpenWeatherMap's [website](openweathermap.org/api);
2. Location: using the format 'City, SC' where
    1. City = name of your city;
    2. SC= two letter state code, eg. US;
3. Unit of measurement: 'celsius' or 'fahreneit'.
